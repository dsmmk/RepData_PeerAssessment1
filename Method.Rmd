# STEPS ANALYSIS
## Peer Assignment 1
## Repdata-036: Reproducible Research

The following code ingests the steps data from the repository
```{r,echo=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv('~mkaplan/coursera/repo/RepData_PeerAssessment1/activity.csv')
```

To obtain the total number of steps per day, aggregate the steps column of by date value and apply the sum function: 

```{r}
steps.per.day <- aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$date), FUN=sum,simplify=TRUE)[,2]
hist(steps.per.day)
```
The mean and median steps per day are computed as follows:
```{r}
mean.steps.per.day <- aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$date), FUN=mean,simplify=TRUE,na.action=TRUE)
rbind(activity$date, mean.steps.per.day)

median.steps.per.day <- aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$date), FUN=median,simplify=TRUE,na.action=NULL)
rbind(activity$date, median.steps.per.day)
```
